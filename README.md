# GTA5SightseerApp
That spinny app thingy from GTA5, mainly seen on heists, some missions or sightseer or other stuff idk. took me like 6 hours but no one cares so k
# Stuff
there's a bug where sometimes the green text wont do stuff (line up, soz writing this 
at 2am im drunk on only 14% oxygen or something idk)

so basically, ignore it unless you want to spend like an hour trying to override literal 
DLL executed functions responsible for the fluidic/animative dynamics of the letters and stuff falling 
and rising back to the top, which btw i cant hide when it pops back tothe top.
tho i could fix the issue i said first about not lining up, just cant be bothered to atm too tired, rip in cocopops me
